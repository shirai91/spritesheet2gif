How to convert a spritesheet to gif

Step 1 : put an spritesheet into inputs folder (sprite animation should place in order from left to right, top to bottom)

Step 2 : cd to source code folder, type

> python main.py file_name_in_inputs_folder row col frameLength

frameLength is number of frames in spritesheet you want to capture.
